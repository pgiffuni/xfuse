//! End-to-end tests for writing.
//!
//! Every test here does the same round trip: copy a golden image, mount it,
//! change a file through the mount point, unmount, mount it again, and check
//! that the change is there.  The image is a file rather than a block device,
//! which is how the golden images are built, so the tests do not need root.
//!
//! What these tests can and cannot prove is worth being explicit about.  They
//! prove that the file system wrote what it was asked to write, that it reads
//! back what it wrote, and -- where `xfs_repair` is available -- that the
//! result is still a file system that XFS itself considers consistent.  They
//! cannot prove that the kernel's own XFS driver would mount the result, because
//! that needs a block device and root; `xfs_repair` is the next best witness
//! available without them.
