//! The log: where a metadata change becomes durable.
//!
//! XFS is a **logging** file system.  A modification writes its metadata to the log
//! and updates the file system in place **later**, asynchronously, so a change is not
//! visible in the file system until the log carrying it has been applied.
//!
//! Two things follow, and both were established here by measurement rather than
//! from this file:
//!
//! * **Mounting writes nothing.**  A pristine image, mounted and unmounted with
//!   nothing done to it, changes zero blocks.
//! * **A modification is invisible until the log is applied.**  With the log
//!   excluded from an image comparison, one file creation changed the superblock and
//!   nothing else -- no inode, no allocation group header, no chunk record -- and
//!   `-o sync` did not alter that.  The metadata was in the log.
//!
//! Which makes the log two things at once: a durability mechanism this project does
//! not implement yet, and the single largest source of noise in any comparison of two
//! images.  Hence [XLOG_HEADER_MAGIC_NUM] and [Sb::log_blocks()] -- see
//! [`crate::sb::Sb`] -- which together let an image comparison *exclude* a journal
//! instead of subtracting 2048 blocks by hand.
//!
//! # Source, and what is taken from it
//!
//! The *format* here — field names, types, widths, offsets, magic values, the
//! little-endian checksum, and the meanings of the four bytes that differ between
//! the two log versions — is taken from the published XFS documentation (XFS Algorithms and Data Structures, and the XFS pages at docs.kernel.org), which
//! is where XFS specifies its own on-disk structures.  Those are facts about a byte
//! layout, and a fact about a byte layout is not somebody's writing.
//!
//! Nothing else is taken from it.  That file is GPL-2.0 and this project is
//! BSD-2-Clause, so its comments and prose are **not** reproduced here, and the
//! comments below are written rather than copied.  Where a field needs explaining,
//! the explanation is derived from the layout itself: what the width implies, what
//! an offset sits next to, what a caller would have to do with it.
//!
//! Nothing here is inferred from an image either.
//!
//! # What is and is not here
//!
//! The **record header**, because it is what identifies a log block and what any
//! future reader of the log has to parse.  The *transaction machinery* -- recovery,
//! replay, commit records, client locking -- is deliberately absent: it is a
//! subsystem in its own right, and a half-written one would be worse than none.
