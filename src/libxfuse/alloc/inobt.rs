//! The b-tree that indexes which inode numbers a group has used.
//!
//! Where the free space btrees in [`super::free_space`] answer "which blocks are
//! free", this one answers "which inode numbers are in use", and it answers it
//! about *blocks* of inodes rather than about single inodes.  A part-used block
//! of inodes is in the tree; the free inodes inside it are free.
//!
//! That distinction is the whole reason the free inode count in the
//! [group inode header](super::agi) cannot be answered from this tree: the tree
//! says which ranges are used, and says nothing about the gaps between them.
//!
//! # The two shapes of a node
//!
//! The tree is shaped like every other b-tree here, and the shapes differ in how
//! much a record costs:
//!
//! | | a record costs | so a node holds |
//! |:-|:-:|:-:|
//! | a leaf | 16 bytes -- the first inode number, how many are free, the first free one, and a fourth field nothing here reads | `(blocksize - 16) / 16` |
//! | an interior node | 8 bytes -- a four byte key and a four byte pointer | `(blocksize - 16) / 8` |
//!
//! The free count and the first free inode are there for a file system that
//! tracks free inodes in a tree of their own.  On a version 1 header, which has
//! no such tree, they are zero and the gaps between the ranges are where the
//! free inodes are.
