//! Handing out blocks from a group, through a transaction.
//!
//! # What this is
//!
//! [`FreeSpace`](super::free_space::FreeSpace) knows how to take blocks out of a
//! group's two free space trees, and is given a group in memory because that is
//! what makes an allocation testable.  This is the other half: the group as it is
//! actually stored, where every block read and written goes through a
//! transaction, and where the group's own header has to be told what happened.
//!
//! # Why all of it goes through one transaction
//!
//! An allocation changes three things: a leaf in each of the two free space
//! trees, and the group header's count of what is left.  All three have to move
//! together, because a group header that says a block is free when its tree says
//! it is taken is a block that gets handed out twice.  Nothing here writes to the
//! image: the caller begins a transaction, this fills it, and committing makes
//! the whole change real at once.  A transaction that is never committed leaves
//! the image exactly as it was.
//!
//! # Blocks, sectors, and why the header is read as bytes
//!
//! A group header sits at a fixed *sector* within the group, and a sector is
//! the file system's basic block, which is not always a whole file system block:
//! with 1 KiB blocks and 512-byte sectors the header starts half way through a
//! block.  In the first group that half of the block is the superblock.  So the
//! header is read and written as bytes at a computed offset, and the block around
//! it is never written as a whole -- writing it would take the superblock with
//! it.
//!
//! # What this does not do
//!
//! It does not merge a leaf that has fallen below half full, so a group with
//! such a leaf reports itself full for runs that leaf would have served.  It
//! does not reclaim a block, which means inserting a run and merging it with its
//! neighbours, so freeing a block belongs with the operation that frees one.  And
//! it does not put anything in the group's free list, which in the images tested
//! here is not initialised at all.

    /// The published documentation does not settle it either, and it is worth
    /// recording why so that nobody goes looking again.  Its `xfs_db` example
    /// does have a populated list -- `flfirst = 22`, `fllast = 27`, `flcount = 6`
    /// -- but the numbers in it are illustrative rather than from a real file
    /// system: its `agf_freeblks` of 3,654,234 is nearly ten times the
    /// `agf_length` of 393,122 for the same header, and that length is
    /// confirmed by the superblock the same document quotes, since 16 groups of

    /// What would settle it: a real file system whose free-space btree has

/// 128, 160 and 192 inodes apart, so the spacing is not the nominal 64 and it is
/// not even one number.  A file system with a free inode bitmap asks it where
/// there is room; this one has none to ask (`free_root` is zero in every group of
/// every image here), so the only things that can say are the group's own free
/// space and its own metadata.
///
/// So the candidates are the chunk-aligned block ranges in the group, and a
/// candidate is usable when the bno tree holds every one of its blocks as free.
/// The trees already exclude the group's headers and its own inode tree -- the
/// group header, the inode header, the free list, the two free space trees and
/// every inode in it are not in the bno tree -- so a candidate that is free is
/// also a candidate that is not metadata.
///
/// # What the slots are written as
///
/// All zeroes, which is **a choice and not a measurement**.  Every free inode in
/// `xfsv4.img` has an entirely zero slot, magic included, and `xfs_repair -n`
/// accepts the image with 52 of them -- so all-zero is a state XFS leaves behind
/// and a legal thing to write.  What is *not* established is that it is what XFS
/// writes when it creates a chunk: no chunk in any image here was created by an
/// operation this suite can watch.  A file that later takes one of these inodes
/// has every field of it written by `allocate_ino`, so nothing downstream depends
/// on what was here.
///

///
/// Inserting into a tree whose leaves are all full needs a split, and a split

    /// xfs_4kn.img       all groups  window (1,4,4)   0 slots outside
    /// ```

    /// The two images `mkfs.xfs` produced — `xfs_writable.img` and
    /// `xfs_4kn.img` — have **never consumed a list entry at all**, in any of
    /// their eight groups.  Their windows are all at slot 1 with four entries and
    /// nothing outside them, which is the state a freshly made file system is in.
    /// So there is no evidence here of what a consumed entry becomes.

    /// The only trace is in `xfsv4.img`, and that image is **hand-built** by
    /// `scripts/mkimg.sh` rather than made by a file system.  Its 14 free-space
    /// blocks are as likely to be the script's doing as a file system's, and the

    /// What is also solid, and worth recording because it is a difference from
    /// this implementation: **the slots a list has passed over still hold their
    /// block numbers.**  In group 1 of `xfsv4.img`, 84 of the 128 slots are
    /// non-null outside a six-entry window, and 62 of them name blocks that are
    /// b-tree nodes right now.  `Agfl::take_front` nulls the slot it takes,
    /// which XFS evidently does not.  Both are safe, and for the same reason: the
    /// group header says which slots are live, so a value outside the window is a
    /// leftover and not an offer — which is exactly what `Agfl::window_holds`
    /// assumes when it refuses a duplicate, and exactly why nothing here scans the
    /// array.  Nulling is kept because it makes a blank slot distinguishable from a
    /// stale one for anything that ever reads the array without the header.
